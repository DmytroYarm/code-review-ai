The main thing we should increasing the number of containers and using Kubernetes for orchestration
It's also possible to use Celery for asynchronous distribution of the task order

In the test task, I already used Redis to cache repository data, which will speed up re-requests and reduce the load

To save costs, we can limiting the use of expensive models, only for key parts of the code. Distribute requests to less
resource-intensive models for fast reviews

And I think it's also right to think about cloud services
